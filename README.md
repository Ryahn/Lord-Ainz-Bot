### About Dev
> This bot came out of boredom while driving a truck everyday. I am a hobbyist programmer and still have a lot of things to learn. 

<br>

### About Bot
> Premise of the bot is to allow clans to battle each other and keep track. Allows tournaments between players in their respective clans as well. 

<br>

### Contributing
> I am looking for anyone who would like to lend a hand and hopefully have the same vision/ideals on how to code the bot. I have to emphasize on that I am still new to coding with discord.js.
